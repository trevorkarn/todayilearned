I"º<p>This semester I have been TAâ€™ing for Calculus II (MATH 1272) at the University of Minnesota.
Today is the day of their final exam, so I want to take a moment to reflect on the semester.
I certainly have learned a lot about teaching, but right now Iâ€™m reminded of a blog post by
Terry Tao, enouraging us to <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-and-relearn-your-field/">â€œlearn and relearn your fieldâ€</a>.</p>
